# 🏭 OpenFactory

**OpenFactory** is a framework for deploying and coordinating industrial assets in a scalable, programmable way.

It brings modern software principles—version control, CI/CD, simulation, and traceability—to the physical world.

Developed at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/), OpenFactory supports research and education around smart manufacturing and edge-native industrial software.

## 🚧 Why OpenFactory

Factories today are often fragile:

- Configurations are hidden in vendor tools
- Deployments are manual and error-prone
- Data is fragmented, delayed, or lost
- Scaling across assets leads to brittle systems

OpenFactory takes a different approach: make the factory programmable and testable by design.

## 🔧 What It Does

With OpenFactory:

- Assets are described as **versioned YAML**
- Systems are **deployed declaratively**
- Simulations can run before hardware is touched
- CI/CD pipelines manage **real-world deployments**
- Data streams flow in **real time**
- Changes are **traceable, auditable, and testable**

It’s not just about collecting data — it’s about making factories collaborative and reproducible.

## 🛠️ Core Ideas

- **Factories as Code** — assets described in config, not locked in GUIs
- **Declarative Deployment** — describe what you want; the platform enforces it
- **Simulation Before Steel** — test in software before commissioning
- **Real-Time Collaboration** — assets communicate via data streams
- **GitOps for the Real World** — every change is versioned and auditable
